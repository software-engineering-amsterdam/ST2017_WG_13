## Overview of our Folder Structure ##

This repository seperates the team submissions from the team members personal work. Next to that, all work is seperated into that of one's week.

```Haskell

/ Team /

    [ ( show week ) ++ "/ {FILES}" | week <- [ 1..8 ] ]  

/ Members / 

    [ member ++ "/" ++ (show week) ++ "/ {FILES}" | 
         
         member <- [ "11424907-ToineKhonraad",
                     "11721677-PaulSpencer",
                     "11784873-MichaelOlivari",
                     "11858990-LeóGunnarVídisson" ],
