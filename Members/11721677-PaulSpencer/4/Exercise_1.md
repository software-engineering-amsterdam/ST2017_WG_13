# Question
> Read or reread Chapter 4 of The Haskell Road, and make a list of questions on specific points that cause difficulty of understanding.

# Purpose
The question here, and in question 5, could appear to the naive student to be the self incriminating question "what part of these texts are you too stupid to understand". This is similar in vein to the interview question "What is your greatest weakness", which is a question that can be read as "how did you overcome adversity", but only by those who cant read, and more clearly read as "give me some reasons not to hire you".  The more pure of heart, face value, type of student could read this as "make a list of questions on specific points that cause difficulty of understanding.", and being pure of heart they would reply with said list, unquestioningly. (this is, of course, how we will answer, because naturally we want to score the points). 

A group of cynical students, however, might ask themselves what is the purpose of these questions that are so unconnected to the style of all previous questions?  One of the possible conclusions they might come up with is that one of the authors of the book, who happens to be the previous class lecturer and author of these two questions, was looking for feedback from people whom had read their book on how to improve it for future editions.  Now, we are not such a cynical group, our later list of specific points show that we are, obviously, examples of the pure of heart students. 

## Advice of cynical students
If we were such a group, what follows would be some advice that we would give, (under the assumption that the purpose of the book was to help students learn and remember the theory, and not that the book is only to be read by those who are forced to):
* Analogies: use them a lot these help people make connections between the abstract and the concrete 
* Interleaving: placing some "call back" exercises helps spaced learning.
* More visual examples: words written down tend to be optimised for the production of material not the consumption. Some people are more visual learners. ()
* Simple: distilling to the most important idea at the core
    * do not bury the lead - put your intent at the top (Commander Intent - CI)
    * build on existing ideas that the reader already has
* Unexpected: get the attention and keep it
    * Figure out what is counter-intuitive about the message then tell your readers in a way that breaks their guessing machines
    * think of mystery / click bait - "is there a murderer next door? find out after the break!"
* Concrete: it can be described or detected by the human senses
    * avoid the "curse of knowledge" - as experts you are describing abstract ideas that a novice might not know, first break it to the concrete and then build to the abstract
* Credibility: if you have an authority figure, use them, else:
    * use an anti-authority
    * use concrete details
    * use statistics
    * find a test case that makes it credible
    * or make your statements testable 
* Emotional: make people care about this
    * Association / semantic stretch: 
    * self interest - focus on benefit not feature
    * appeal to identity
* Stories: have the following plot:
    * Challenge: overcome challenge
    * Connection: a connection that bridges a divide
    * Creativity: making a mental breaktrhough

The above advice is from the book, Made to Stick: Why some ideas survive and others die by Chip Heath and Dan Heath, a must read for lecturers and writers alike.

How would we apply it to the chapters 4 and 5? This would be a question that would be answered by a cynical group of students or by any student directly asked this. 

# Actual Questions
As this was not the question there follows a list of items from chapter 4 that we did not clearly understand: 

(these are questions from Paul)
1. we talk about Zermelo's Axioms with no reference to finding them, what were they?
1. it is not clear how the Russell Paradox is of use (especially as Haskell precludes it with types)
1. can we have sets that contain themselves in haskell (other than a recursive infinite list)
1. what does resp. mean? the internet leads me to believe it is respective/respecively.  never seen it written before.
1. when we say that a set is has reflexivity, antisymmetry or transitivity, how is this related to the very same words being used in Chapter 5 to describe relations. if there is a difference or similarity why is this not pointed out?
1. I don't feel any clearer in my understanding of the halting problem after reading the description than before - `funny` does not make it clearer. (not a question, just a comment - had to look it up on wikipedia)
1. Generalized Union and Intersection, both the definition and the following explanation.
1. powerList (powerList (powerList (powerList empty))) did not leave me feeling enlightened.  it's follow up in haskell, `display 88 (take 1760 (show v5))`, had simularities to the last page of a long lisp program.
