  According to wikipedia:
  
  The formula verifies a number against its included check digit, 
  which is usually appended to a partial account number to generate 
  the full account number. This number must pass the following test:

  From the rightmost digit, which is the check digit, and moving left, 
  double the value of every second digit. 
    
  If the result of this doubling operation is greater than 9 
  (e.g., 8 Ã— 2 = 16), then add the digits of the product 
  (e.g., 16: 1 + 6 = 7, 18: 1 + 8 = 9) or alternatively subtract 9 
  from the product (e.g., 16: 16 - 9 = 7, 18: 18 - 9 = 9).
  
  Take the sum of all the digits.
  
  If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 (if the total ends in zero) 
  then the number is valid according to the Luhn formula; 
  else it is not valid.
