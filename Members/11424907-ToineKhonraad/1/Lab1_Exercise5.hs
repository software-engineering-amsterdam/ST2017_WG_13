  running "findFirst 101 primes"
  
  then gives us the answer 37447
                           =====
  
  Testing this would effectively mean testing that functions
  like "take" and "sum" act as expected.
  
  Yet, as to gain more confidence we could come up with a
  list of pairs like so:
-}

find_pairs_till :: Integer -> [ (Integer, Integer ) ]
find_pairs_till n = [ ( k, findFirst k primes ) | k <- takeWhile (<=n) primes ]

{-

  And lift this to a printable report:
-}

tabularReport :: Integer -> IO ()
tabularReport n = mapM_ print $ find_pairs_till n

{-
  running "tabularReport 101" then gives us:
  
    (2,5)
