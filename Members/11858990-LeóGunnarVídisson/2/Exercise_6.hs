-- Implementing and testing ROT13 encoding

-- ROT13 is a single letter substitution cipher that is used in online forums for hiding spoilers.

-- See also www.rot13.com.

-- First, give a specification of ROT13.

-- Next, give a simple implementation of ROT13.

-- Finally, turn the specification into a series of QuickCheck testable properties, and use these to test 
-- your implementation.
