-- Deliverables: 
-- ☒ generator for formulas
-- ☒ sequence of test properties
-- ☒ test report
-- ☒ indication of time spent

-- Write a formula generator for random testing of properties of propositional logic, or teach yourself 
-- enough QuickCheck to use random QuickCheck testing of formulas.

-- Use your random testing method to test the correctness of the conversion program from the previous 
-- exercise. Formulate a number of relevant properties to test, and carry out the tests, 
-- either with your own random formula generator or with QuickCheck.
