-- Deliverables: 
-- ☒ conversion program with documentation,
-- ☒ indication of time spent.

-- The lecture notes of this week discuss the conversion of Boolean formulas (formulas of propositional logic) 
-- into CNF form. The lecture notes also give a definition of a Haskell datatype for formulas of 
-- propositional logic, using lists for conjunctions and disjunctions. Your task is to write a Haskell 
-- program for converting formulas into CNF.
