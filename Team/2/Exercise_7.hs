-- Implementing and testing IBAN validation

-- The International Bank Account Number (IBAN) was designed to facility international money transfer, 
-- to uniquely identify bank accounts worldwide. It is described here, including a procedure for validating 
-- IBAN codes. Write a function

-- iban :: String -> Bool
-- that implements this validation procedure.

-- Next, test your implementation using some suitable list of examples.

-- Note It is not enough to test only with correct examples. You should invent a way to test with incorrect 
-- examples also.

-- Can you automate the test process?

-- Deliverables: Haskell program, concise test report, indication of time spent.
