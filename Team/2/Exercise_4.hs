-- Recognizing Permutations

-- A permutation of a finite list is another finite list with the same elements, but possibly in a different 
-- order. For example, [3,2,1] is a permutation of [1,2,3], but [2,2,0] is not. Write a function

--  isPermutation :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> Bool
-- that returns True if its arguments are permutations of each other.

-- Next, define some testable properties for this function, and use a number of well-chosen lists to test 
-- isPermutation. You may assume that your input lists do not contain duplicates. What does this mean for 
-- your testing procedure?

-- Provide an ordered list of properties by strength using the weakear and stronger definitions.

-- Can you automate the test process? Use the techniques presented in this week's lecture. Also use QuickCheck.
