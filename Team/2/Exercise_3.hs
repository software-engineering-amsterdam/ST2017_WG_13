Testing properties strength

Considering the following predicate on test properties:

> stronger, weaker :: [a] -> (a -> Bool) -> (a -> Bool) -> Bool
> stronger xs p q = forall xs (\ x -> p x --> q x)
> weaker   xs p q = stronger xs q p 


a) Implement all properties from the Exercise 3 from 
   Workshop 2 as Haskell functions of type Int -> Bool. 
   Consider a small domain like [(âˆ’10)..10].

b) Provide a descending strength list of all the implemented properties.

  The fifth property given in the list above is added so to atleast have one that is 
  incomparable to the others.
