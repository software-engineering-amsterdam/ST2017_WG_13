## Specifications of problem ##
> Read or reread Chapter 4 of The Haskell Road, and make a list of questions on specific points that cause difficulty of understanding.

## Questions

1. We talk about Zermelo's Axioms with no reference to finding them, what were they?
1. It is not clear how the Russell Paradox is of use (especially as Haskell precludes it with types)
1. Can we have sets that contain themselves in haskell (other than a recursive infinite list)
1. What does resp. mean? the internet leads me to believe it is respective/respecively. though I have never seen it written before.
1. When we say that a set is has reflexivity, antisymmetry or transitivity, how is this related to the very same words being used in Chapter 5 to describe relations. if there is a difference or similarity why is this not pointed out?
1. I don't feel any clearer in my understanding of the halting problem after reading the description than before - the function `funny` does not make it clearer. (not a question, just a comment - had to look it up on wikipedia)
1. I did not get Generalized Union and Intersection, both the definition and the following explanation.
1. powerList (powerList (powerList (powerList empty))) did not leave me feeling enlightened.  It's implementation in haskell, `display 88 (take 1760 (show v5))`, had simularities to the last page of a long lisp program.

## Notes
There was discussion with regards to the purpose of Question 1 and 4. It is noted that this discussion is superflous to this answer, however, for the curious, the discussion can be found on Pauls Member page.
